# Extra Spicy Movie Recommender

This is a recommender made asa [art of Spiced Academy's Data Science course. It is not a good one, but it does make recomendations.
With more time it could be optimized.
Currently it uses Neighborhood Based Collaborative Filtering (Cosine Similarity)
We also covered Non-Negative Matrix Factorization, but I did not get to it.
